          <p><strong /></p>

          <p>ALL PARTIES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY. The
                        exclusive
                        means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions
                        (including
                        any alleged breach thereof) or the Site shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the
                        American
                        Arbitration Association ("AAA"), in accordance with the AAA Arbitration Rules then in effect,
          </p>

          <p>The arbitration proceeding shall be kept confidential by the parties, their representatives and
                        the
                        arbitrator, subject to the right of any party to enforce the arbitral award. Each party shall
                        bear its own
                        costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrator's and administrative fees of
                        arbitration. The
                        arbitrator may proceed to an award, notwithstanding the failure of either party to participate
                        in the
                        proceedings. The arbitrator shall, within thirty (30)calendar days after the conclusion of the
                        arbitration
                        hearing, issue a written award and statement of decision setting forth the findings of fact and
                        conclusions
                        of law on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The
                        arbitrator also
                        shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief
                        the
                        arbitrators deem just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including, without
                        limitation,
                        an injunction or order for specific performance. Judgment on the award rendered by the
                        arbitrator may be
          </p>

          <p>By using the Site, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR
                        RIGHT TO GO TO
                        COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Company or its affiliates. YOU ALSO GIVE UP
                        YOUR RIGHT
                        TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a
                        NEUTRAL
                        ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The
                        arbitrator
                        can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are
                        usually simpler
                        and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are
                        enforceable
          </p>

          <p>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm,
                        modify, or vacate
                        an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that
                        this
                        arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Company
                        may be
                        commenced only in the federal or state courts located in New York, New York. You hereby
                        irrevocably consent
                        to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes. These Terms and Conditions, and any
                        dispute between
                        you and Company, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to
                        principles of
                        conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal
